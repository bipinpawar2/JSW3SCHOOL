// string can be object and Don't create strings as objects. It slows down execution speed.

var y = new String("John");  // y is an object
console.log(x)
console.log(y)         //returns data and value .
//Objects cannot be compared:
//if we try to compare object by == then also it gives  false because (x is string and y is object).

/*The two methods, indexOf() and search(), are equal?
They accept the same arguments (parameters), and return the same value?
The two methods are NOT equal. These are the differences:
The search() method cannot take a second start position argument. therefore methods of extraction is us.
The indexOf() method cannot take powerful search values (regular expressions). */

///1) The slice() Method
/*
slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.

The method takes 2 parameters: the start position, and the end position (end not included).

//2)substring() method
//it same as slice ,the difference is that substring() cannot accept negative indexes means no negative value like(-7,-13).     

//3)substr() method.
/*substr() is similar to slice().
The difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part
