        First root elements<html>.
         2 nd is elements (head,body,title),attribue("href").

        JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
        JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
        JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
        JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
        JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
        JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
        JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page.
